# Web Scraper AI

## Overview
This is a web scraping project that combines AI with automation. It pulls data from websites using **Selenium** and **BeautifulSoup**, processes it with **Pandas**, and presents it in a structured table using **Streamlit**. To enhance the functionality, **Llama 3.1** is integrated for AI-based analysis on the scraped data.

Right now, the scraper can fetch data and display it neatly in a table. The next step is adding a **download feature**, so users can export the table easily.

## Tech Stack
- **Python** – Core programming language
- **Selenium** – For browser automation
- **BeautifulSoup** – For parsing website data
- **Streamlit** – To create an interactive UI
- **Pandas** – For structuring and manipulating data
- **Llama 3.1** – AI model for additional insights

## Work in Progress
- [ ] Adding a **download option** for the scraped table
- [ ] Improving **error handling** for more stable scraping
- [ ] Optimizing **performance** for faster data retrieval

This is an ongoing project, and more features will be added soon. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome!
